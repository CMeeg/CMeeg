# Hi! 👋

_I'm a web developer at [Ridgeway](https://www.ridgeway.com/) based in Witney, UK. Web development's also a hobby of mine so when I can find the time I'm working away on my own projects, which you can find here on GitHub._

* 🚀 I created the [nextjs-aca](https://github.com/CMeeg/nextjs-aca) and [remix-aca](https://github.com/CMeeg/remix-aca) Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) templates for a speedy way to get a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Remix](https://remix.run/) site hosted in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
* 🧰 I love the developer tool [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) (an `nvm` alternative) and I'm a [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) user so I created the [fnm-chocolatey](https://github.com/CMeeg/fnm-chocolatey) [package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/fnm)
* ✏ I built my [personal blog](https://github.com/CMeeg/meeg-blog) using [Astro](https://github.com/CMeeg/meeg-blog) and [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/)

📬 You can find my blog and social links in my profile if you want to get in touch.
